 I  wanted to make it easier to create README's for the various projects I make on GitHub.  This application prompts the user with a series of questions then auto populates a professional grade README for thier GitHub. I have learned many things in building this including modularization, asynchronous functions, npm, inquirer and Node.js.


 To get the development environment running, open the index.js file then use the intergrated terminal and at the prompt enter <node index.js> then answer the questions and your README will autopopulate for you.
